                    <p>A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or more
                        human occupants, and sometimes various companion animals. It is a fully- or semi-sheltered space
                        and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it.[vague] Homes provide sheltered spaces,
                        for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food,
                        eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working,
                        studying and playing.

                    <p>Information is an abstract concept that refers to something which has the power to inform. At the
                        most fundamental level, it pertains to the interpretation (perhaps formally) of that which may
                        be sensed, or their abstractions. Any natural process that is not completely random and any
                        observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information. Whereas
                        digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information, other phenomena and
                        artifacts such as analogue signals, poems, pictures, music or other sounds, and currents convey
                        information in a more continuous form.[1] Information is not knowledge itself, but the meaning
                        that may be derived from a representation through interpretation.

                        An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument, but the
                        definition is vague, overlapping with those of a letter, a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a
                        short story. Essays have been sub-classified as formal and informal: formal essays are
                        characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal
                        essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and
                        experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality
                        or novelty of theme,"

                        Content. The content of an essay is based around research of the topic. This means explaining
                        and justifying your ideas based on information and examples from reliable sources. It is
                        important that your essay has a central idea or argument that the essay content is focussed on.
                        This is known as a thesis statement.
